# Structure <sup>![version badge](https://v.egoist.moe/gh/neopostmodern/structure.svg)</sup>

Structure is a performance-at-interaction oriented and reasonably stylish bookmarking tool for (eventually) everything.

It is work in progress, but values stability since it is in use already. 
Binaries / packaged applications can be found in [releases](https://github.com/neopostmodern/structure/releases). 
Keep in mind that these will use private server infrastructure, a privacy and security risk you do not necessarily want to take. 
Feel free to build and deploy the app and required server infrastructure yourself. 
See [below](https://github.com/neopostmodern/structure#server) on how to do so.

## Build / deploy

### Client

Configuration values are stored in `config.prod.json` (`config.dev.json` respectively for development).

```bash
npm run package-all
```
(Or to only target a specific platform: `package-linux` / `package-win` / `package-macos`).
AppImage (Linux), .exe (NSIS-Installer for Windows) and .tar.gz (macOS) are placed in `./release`

### Server

Deployment script variables are stored in `server/deploy/server.sh`, 
environment variables for server are stored in `server/deploy/config.json`.
Example files coming soon (#6).
```bash
cd server
npm run deploy
```
